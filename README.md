# freeCodeCamp DataVisualization d 3 - bar chart
d3 bar-chart-visualization -- solo project from freeCodeCamp data visualization-course

This repo contains the first data-visualization from fCC data-visualization-course.
It is a simple bar-chart built on my own from scratch using d3 according to user stories (see below). 

Live demo available: *coming soon*


Note: There is a testscript from freeCodeCamp included confirming fullfilling of user stories.

### User Stories
User Story #1: My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title".

User Story #2: My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".

User Story #3: My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
